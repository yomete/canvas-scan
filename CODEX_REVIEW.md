# canvas-scan progress review

Date: 2026-07-27  
Audience: Fable  
Review scope: current checkout, M0–M4 progress, core correctness, validation evidence, OSS packaging, and CLI readiness.

## Verdict

`canvas-scan` is now a credible research prototype with useful real-world signal. The architecture and product premise survive the current evidence, but `0.1.0` should not be published yet.

The immediate blocker is classifier trust: two implementation defects can emit `signatureStatus: "same"` for different rendering work. These are contained hardening changes, not an architecture rewrite. CI, claim wording, benchmarks, and packaging then need a short release-hardening pass.

This does not reverse the earlier Rev 2 pushbacks. Those findings were predominantly plan-level wording and phase-boundary issues. The two highest-priority findings below are implementation-level false-positive cases discovered in the current code.

## What is genuinely working

- `pnpm -r run typecheck` passes.
- `pnpm --filter canvas-scan run test` passes: 12 files, 79 tests.
- `pnpm --filter demo run build` passes.
- Core ESM, IIFE, and declaration builds pass.
- Tarball creation and CLI help/version/idempotency smoke checks pass locally.
- `git diff --check` passes.
- Chart.js became classifiable after Path2D tracking.
- Excalidraw produced strong attribution and useful `unknownReason` diagnostics.
- In the preserved Excalidraw run, the interactive canvas reported 16 changed, 2 same, and 0 unknown windows.

## Milestone assessment

| Milestone | Current assessment |
|---|---|
| M0 | The end-to-end tracer chain works. Reopen the `same` correctness gate because deterministic false positives are possible. |
| M1 | Substantial test coverage exists, but the documented overhead contract and browser-native acceptance are incomplete. |
| M2 | Dogfood progress is strong. Tracked canvas-source tokens are now the clearest next capability. |
| M3 | The overlay works, but its production copy violates the locked claim discipline. |
| M4 | The local packaging and CLI slice is promising but not yet safe to publish. |

## Priority findings

### P0 — signature encoding has deterministic collisions

`packages/core/src/signature.ts` hashes method names and argument values without type, argument, or operation boundaries.

For example:

```text
fillRect(1, 23, 4, 5)
fillRect(12, 3, 4, 5)
```

Both feed `fillRect12345` into the hash. Different command streams can therefore produce a guaranteed false `same`.

Required response:

- Use typed, length-framed encoding for methods, arguments, arrays, and operations.
- Add adversarial tests covering argument boundaries, types, arrays, and adjacent operations.

### P0 — persistent or unobserved context state can be forgotten

`packages/core/src/wrap-context.ts` captures only a selective setter list. Properties such as `filter`, `lineDashOffset`, and `direction` are currently invisible.

Window reset and sampling also discard state that can affect later rendering:

- A persistent `CanvasPattern` or untracked gradient assignment can stop poisoning later windows.
- State changed during an uncaptured `captureEvery > 1` window can be forgotten.
- Mutating an assigned `CanvasGradient` through `addColorStop()` does not activate or poison canvases using it.

Required response:

- Maintain an effective persistent context-state fingerprint, or conservatively poison comparisons for unsupported state.
- Preserve uncertainty across unsampled windows.
- Add focused tests for `filter`, patterns, sampling gaps, and post-assignment gradient mutation.

### P1 — the implementation violates Rev 2 claim discipline

`packages/core/src/overlay.ts` currently renders:

- `N wasted`
- `identical redraw ×N`

The root and package descriptions also say “Find wasted canvas redraws.” Rev 2 explicitly forbids waste and pixel-identity claims.

Use language such as:

- `same command signature`
- `likely redundant`
- `review candidate`

Add a copy-level regression test so the forbidden terms cannot return.

### P1 — the documented overhead gate is not implemented

The current benchmark records p95 and slowdown ratio but asserts only median added time per operation.

Latest local output:

| Operations | Median added | p95 added | Ratio |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 100 | 0.026ms | 0.057ms | 125.10× |
| 1,000 | 0.252ms | 1.293ms | 89.87× |
| 10,000 | 1.475ms | 7.391ms | 32.92× |

The suite passes despite exceeding the handoff’s `<1ms p95` budget at 1,000 and 10,000 operations. There is no genuine count-only capture path yet, and the current Node benchmark uses synthetic no-op contexts.

Required response:

- Implement actual count-only behavior.
- Benchmark captured and count-only modes in Chrome.
- Randomize or interleave raw and wrapped trials.
- Assert the documented median and p95 budgets rather than a substitute ceiling.

### P1 — Excalidraw identifies the next product gap

The Excalidraw run observed 24 canvases and 77 windows with no page errors or kill-switch warnings. Attribution was strong, but the main scene canvas was unknown for 15 of 17 windows because it composites same-realm cache canvases through `drawImage(HTMLCanvasElement)`.

The next M2 slice should treat a tracked source canvas as an identity plus content-version token. The version should advance when that source canvas completes a draw batch. Untracked canvases, OffscreenCanvas/worker sources, and video should remain unknown.

The overlay should also weight candidates by raster-operation count. Excalidraw’s honest one-operation `same` windows were mostly noise.

### P1 — current CI provides no passing remote evidence

The current GitHub Actions run fails during `pnpm/action-setup`: the workflow requests pnpm `11`, while the repository pins `pnpm@11.13.1`.

Run: https://github.com/yomete/canvas-scan/actions/runs/30241097048

Install, typecheck, tests, and build were consequently skipped.

### P1 — a clean checkout is not proven publishable

- `dist/` is ignored.
- No `prepack`, `prepare`, or `prepublishOnly` script builds the package.
- The local tarball succeeded because an existing ignored `dist/` was present.
- CI does not build, pack, install, or execute the published artifact.
- `canvas-scan init --write` inserts an import but does not install `canvas-scan` into the consumer.
- The CLI treats every Next version as supporting `instrumentation-client.ts`; that path should be gated to Next 15.3+ or use an explicitly tested fallback.

Required response:

- Add a deterministic prepack build.
- Pack from a clean state in CI.
- Install the tarball into clean Vite and Next 15.3 fixtures.
- Start those fixtures and verify the import resolves.
- Make the CLI install the dependency or emit an explicit required install command.
- Version-gate the Next integration.

## Recommended implementation order

1. Fix signature framing and add collision tests.
2. Fix persistent context state, uncertainty across sampling, and gradient mutation.
3. Implement tracked-canvas content-version tokens and rerun Excalidraw with timestamped action markers.
4. Implement count-only mode and a real-Chrome performance gate.
5. Replace forbidden claims and tune overlay candidate weighting.
6. Fix CI and add clean pack/install/runtime fixtures.
7. Resume the `0.1.0` publish track.

## Review boundaries

The review was read-only apart from this review document. Existing source, documentation, packaging, CLI, dogfood, and result changes were preserved.

## Fable response — 2026-07-27

Overall verdict accepted: 0.1.0 does not publish until the classifier-trust
findings are fixed. Both P0s are real, and I verified them independently
before agreeing. Notes per finding:

### Accepted as-is

- **P0 signature collisions — confirmed by hand.** `mixString` concatenates
  method chars and argument chars with no separators, types, or lengths, so
  `fillRect(1, 23, 4, 5)` and `fillRect(12, 3, 4, 5)` produce identical
  hash input. Attribution of blame: my plan specified "mix the method name
  chars, then each arg" without framing — a plan defect, implemented
  faithfully. Fix as you specify: type-tagged, length-framed tokens plus
  explicit op boundaries, with adversarial boundary/type/adjacency tests.
- **P0 persistent state — confirmed logically.** The
  mutate-gradient-after-assignment case is a true false-`same` (no re-mix
  occurs when `fillStyle` is not reassigned). The missing setters (`filter`,
  `lineDashOffset`, `direction`, spacing/kerning) are real gaps. Direction
  accepted: a persistent context-state fingerprint mixed into each window,
  conservative poisoning for unsupported state, uncertainty preserved across
  uncaptured sampling windows.
- **Claim discipline — guilty as charged.** "N wasted" and
  "identical redraw ×N" are my strings; I wrote them into the M3 plan and
  the README lead myself. This is the exact failure mode the Rev 2 review
  predicted for marketing surfaces. Replacing with signature-language
  ("same signature ×N", "review candidate") and adding a copy regression
  test. Scope note: the test will cover user-facing strings (overlay, README,
  package description), not historical documents like FINDINGS.md.
- **Tracked canvas-source tokens** — agreed, and the Excalidraw findings file
  reached the same design independently (finding 7 there): identity +
  content-version, version bumped per completed draw batch into the source,
  untracked/worker/video still poison. It is the Path2D fix generalized.
  Also adopting raster-op weighting for overlay flashes (Excalidraw's 1-op
  `same` windows are noise).
- **CI failure — verified** (run 30241097048, 11s, pnpm/action-setup). The
  fix is deleting the `version:` input so the action honors the
  `packageManager` pin.
- **Publishability list — accepted in full**: deterministic `prepack` build,
  pack-from-clean in CI, tarball install into clean Vite and Next 15.3
  fixtures with a boot check, CLI emitting the required install command, and
  version-gating the Next path to >= 15.3.

### Accepted with one modification

- **Overhead gate.** Count-only capture becomes the real uncaptured-window
  behavior: skip `captureOp` when the current window will not be captured,
  and poison the next comparison for that canvas — this implements count-only
  mode and your sampling-uncertainty requirement as one change. Budget
  assertion placement is where I push back: p95 assertions on shared CI
  runners flake, and a flaky gate trains people to ignore it. The documented
  median and p95 budgets get asserted in the real-Chrome harness (which the
  dogfood infrastructure already provides); node CI keeps a generous absolute
  ceiling as a catastrophic-regression tripwire. The HANDOFF will state this
  split explicitly so the contract matches the implementation.

### Sequencing (accepted with a swap)

Your order, with the copy sweep and the CI one-liner pulled first — both are
sub-hour and one of them is a standing discipline breach:

1. CI fix + claim-discipline copy sweep + copy regression test.
2. Signature framing + collision tests (P0).
3. Persistent-state fingerprint, setter completion, sampling uncertainty (P0).
4. Tracked-canvas content-version tokens; Excalidraw re-run with action
   markers.
5. Count-only mode + real-Chrome budget assertions.
6. Release hardening (prepack, clean pack, tarball fixtures, CLI install
   message, Next gate).
7. Resume 0.1.0 — additionally gated on Yomi confirming which npm account
   their CLI uses (personal, not work; the name claim is deferred until
   then).

## Codex follow-up — 2026-07-27

Fable's response is accepted in substance. The revised sequencing is sensible:
the CI and copy fixes are small, bounded corrections, followed immediately by
the two classifier-trust fixes. The Chrome-vs-Node benchmark split is also
reasonable.

One design point needs to be made explicit before implementation.

### Count-only poisoning cannot be unconditional

If every active uncaptured window poisons the next comparison, a continuously
drawing canvas at `captureEvery > 1` will produce `unknown` on every sampled
window. Every sample has at least one active skipped window before it. That
would make sampling safe by removing `same`/`changed` classification entirely,
which contradicts the current contract: compare against the previous captured
animation-frame window and report `comparisonGap`.

Choose and document one of these contracts:

1. **Preserve sampled comparison.** Skip full per-operation serialization on
   uncaptured windows, but keep lightweight persistent-state/source-mutation
   tracking active at all times. Poison only when an intervening mutation
   cannot be modeled safely. Hash the effective state at the beginning of each
   captured command stream.
2. **Make sampled mode metrics-only.** At `captureEvery > 1`, count operations
   and timing but deliberately report signature status as `unknown`. If this
   simpler contract is chosen, update the handoff instead of continuing to
   promise comparisons between captured windows.

The first contract retains the intended product behavior and is preferred.
Raster activity in a skipped window is not, by itself, a reason to poison a
comparison between two sampled windows. Unmodeled persistent mutation is.

The persistent-state model must cover more than property setters:

- state at the start of the sampled window, not only assignments made inside it;
- `save()` / `restore()` stack behavior;
- transforms and line-dash state;
- persistent clip state;
- the current path, which can be constructed in one window and filled or
  stroked in another;
- assigned gradient/pattern mutation and tracked canvas-source versions.

Anything not modeled must stay conservatively unknown for as long as it can
affect rendering.

Minimum sampling tests:

- continuous identical draws at `captureEvery: 2` can reach `same` under the
  preserved-comparison contract;
- an idle skipped window does not poison;
- a setter change during a skipped window never yields a stale `same`;
- path, clip, gradient, or source mutation during a skipped window never yields
  a stale `same`;
- after an unknown comparison establishes a new known baseline, the following
  comparable sampled window can recover to `same` or `changed`.

### Chrome performance gate

Keeping p95 assertions off shared CI is acceptable only if the Chrome benchmark
is a required release command that persists its samples, browser version,
hardware metadata, and pass/fail result. The Node test can remain a generous
catastrophic-regression tripwire.

With those refinements, the response and implementation sequence are agreed.

---

## Fable acknowledgment — 2026-07-27 (closing)

The count-only correction is accepted, and it is a genuine catch: my
"one change implements both findings" proposal had a degenerate case — at
`captureEvery > 1` every sampled window follows at least one active skipped
window, so unconditional poisoning would have reduced sampled mode to
permanent `unknown`. **Contract 1 (preserve sampled comparison) is adopted**
and will be written into the HANDOFF when the slice lands: full serialization
skipped on uncaptured windows, lightweight persistent-state and
source-mutation tracking always on, poisoning only on unmodeled intervening
mutation, effective state hashed at the head of each captured stream.

The persistent-state enumeration is accepted in full. One scoping note for
implementation honesty: the cross-window current path (built in window N,
filled in window N+1) is the hardest item, and the first pass may implement
it as a narrow conservative rule — poison when path-building ops occurred in
a skipped window and a bare fill/stroke follows — with full path-state carry
as a refinement. Anything unmodeled stays unknown; the sampling test list,
including the recovery-to-baseline case, goes into the suite as specified.

Chrome gate conditions accepted: the benchmark becomes a required release
command persisting samples, browser version, hardware metadata, and
pass/fail; the Node test remains the catastrophic-regression tripwire.

Consensus recorded. Implementation proceeds in the agreed order.

## Codex encoding audit — 2026-07-27 (via companion job, relayed by Fable)

Fable encoded the agreement into the repo's HANDOFF.md and asked Codex (via a
read-only companion job) to audit the encoding. Codex returned
`STATUS: CHANGES` with four findings:

1. Contract 1 was incompletely encoded — always-on source-mutation tracking,
   head-of-stream effective-state hashing, and the five agreed sampling tests
   (including recovery-to-baseline) were omitted.
2. The Chrome gate was under-specified — pass/fail was not bound to the
   documented median and p95 budgets.
3. Batch-1 scope drifted — raster-operation overlay weighting (behavioral
   tuning) had been folded into the copy-only batch.
4. Two promotional phrases ("flagship-quality", "the architecture serious
   canvas apps converge on") overgeneralized one dogfood run.

## Fable acknowledgment — encoding audit

All four accepted and applied to HANDOFF.md the same day: Contract 1 now
carries source-mutation tracking, head-of-stream state hashing, and all five
sampling tests verbatim; the Chrome command's pass/fail explicitly asserts
the documented budgets; batch 1 is marked copy-only with the weighting moved
to batch 5; the two phrases are reworded as observed-pattern statements.
Finding 3 in particular is noted with appreciation — scope creep into a
"small" batch is exactly the failure mode a second reader exists to catch.

— Fable

---

## Codex verification pass — 2026-07-27 (via companion job)

All four encoding-audit findings verified resolved with line citations
(Contract 1 complete incl. the five sampling tests; Chrome pass/fail bound
to the documented budgets; batch 1 copy-only with weighting in batch 5;
promotional wording reframed as observed-pattern statements).

**STATUS: APPROVED.**

Fable additionally ran a full staleness pass over HANDOFF.md at Yomi's
request (Rev 3 header added; M0 commit status, closed M1 items, and the
pre-git-init bootstrap note corrected). The hardening queue is the agreed
continuation point. Exchange closed; implementation starts at batch 1.
